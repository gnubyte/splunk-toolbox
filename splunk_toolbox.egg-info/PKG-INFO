        ## Splunk Toolbox Bio
        
        This is a wrapper around the ITSI API. Where the ITSI API is not 
        functioning, we are using sftp calls instead or core API.
        
        ## Example Uses
        
        
        
        #### Retrieve active search jobs from ITSI
        ```
        from splunk_toolbox import splunkInstance
        
        splunk_server = splunkInstance(authPass='mypass')
        splunk_server.retrieve_search_jobs(recordSearches=1)
        ```
        
        
        #### Post updates to ITSI Notable Event Group
        
        
        ```
        from splunk_toolbox import splunkInstance
        
        
        splunk_server = splunkInstance(authPass='mypass')
        payload ={"status":"5"}
        splunk_server.post_update_to_notable_event_group(payload=payload, )
        ```
        
        
        #### Retrieve all Splunk Core Searches on a given server
        
        if record Searches == 1, a file with the name `recordedSearches.xml` will be generated and saved with todays date and time
        
        ```
        from splunk_toolbox import splunkInstance
        
        splunk_server = splunkInstance(host='someIP', authPass='PASS')
        splunk_server.retrieve_configured_saved_searches(recordSearches=1)
        ```
